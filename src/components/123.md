# Timetable Generation Project Presentation

---

## Slide 1: Project Overview
- Timetable Generation System
- Purpose: To manage academic entities and generate timetables efficiently
- Full-stack web application with React frontend and Express backend

---

## Slide 2: Project Architecture
- Backend: Node.js with Express framework
- Frontend: React.js
- Database: MySQL (using Sequelize ORM)
- RESTful API design for communication between frontend and backend

---

## Slide 3: Backend Structure
- Express server setup in `backend/server.js`
- Routes organized by resource:
  - Authentication (`/api/auth`)
  - Admin (`/api/admin`)
  - Staff (`/api/staff`)
  - Student (`/api/student`)
  - School and Subject management (`/api/schools`, `/api/schools/subjects`)
- Controllers handle business logic (e.g., `subjectController.js`)
- Sequelize models represent database tables (e.g., Subject, Department, Course)

---

## Slide 4: Backend - Subject Management
- CRUD operations for subjects and related entities
- Fetch schools, departments, courses, classes, sections
- Add, update, delete subjects with validation
- Example: `subjectController.js` manages these operations

---

## Slide 5: Frontend Structure
- React components in `src/components/`
- Key component: `ManageSubjects.jsx`
- Uses cascading dropdowns to select school, department, course, class, section
- Supports adding, editing, deleting, and listing subjects
- Communicates with backend API via Axios

---

## Slide 6: Frontend - ManageSubjects Component
- State management with React hooks
- Dynamic fetching of dependent entities on user interaction
- Form for subject details with validation
- Table displaying current subjects with edit and delete options

---

## Slide 7: Database Overview
- MySQL database with tables for:
  - Schools
  - Departments
  - Courses
  - Classes
  - Sections
  - Subjects
- Relationships modeled via foreign keys
- Database schema defined in `database.sql`

---

## Slide 8: Current Status and Future Work
- Subject management fully implemented (backend + frontend)
- Timetable generation logic and UI currently minimal or placeholder
- Future plans:
  - Implement timetable generation algorithms
  - Develop UI for timetable creation and viewing
  - Enhance authentication and role-based access

---

## Slide 9: Summary
- Comprehensive academic management system foundation
- Modular backend and frontend design
- Ready for extension with timetable generation features

---

## Slide 10: Questions
- Thank you for your attention!
- Questions and feedback welcome.
